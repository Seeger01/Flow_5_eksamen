  <h1>DOCUMENTATION</h1>
  <p>There are some photos of my workflow on this project in the gallery above.</p>
  <h1>Learning process</h1>
  <h3>What I've learned during the course?</h3>
  <p>During my first semester, I have learned to use a lot of new programs, including adobe illustrator,Dreamweaver, experience design, Photoshop and GitHub.
    In addition, we have learned to write HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript.
    However, I still feel that I am a beginner, but I also feel I've learned a lot since I started.
    We've also had a lot about wireframes, mood boards, mockups, colors, typography, information architecture, PBS and WBS and much more.</p>
  <h3>How is it related to my prior knowledge of the subject and this task?</h3>
  <p>For this task, I'll use most of what I've learned when I'm going to make re-designs for all the 4 previous flow projects and I'm going to make almost a whole new website for the exam.
    
    I did not have much advance knowledge when I started. The only thing had worked with before was Photoshop. All the other stuff was otherwise mostly new to me.</p>
  <h3>What did I expect to learn?</h3>
  <p>My expectations fit very well with what we have learned and I am very positively surprised by this first semester. There are still lots of things I'm having trouble with but I know this is something I have a passion for, I'm sure Iâ€™m going to get much better.
    
    What I'm most interested in is the coding itself, i.e. HTLM, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, but I like to work in both Photoshop and illustrator as well.</p>
  <h3>What will I do to learn this?</h3>
  <p>To learn it, I feel I just got to work with it all the time and constantly try to improve myself. I will try to keep up with the time by keeping an eye on whether there are new opportunities within the subject and constantly updating myself on what is best to use and how I use it. In addition, I will continue to launch new projects that I hope is going to be better and better. So, I can continue to challenge myself. </p>
  <h3>Visual impression</h3>
  <p>I have chosen to go with Lato as my main font and ariel as my second, because i think it is easy to read and steady on the eyes. The textcolor is white (#ffffff) so i had to find a good dark background color. I chose dark blue (#001931). There are also some grey (#9a9a9a) in the design both in the gallery and as a hover and border effect. I have chosen this to spice the blue color up a bit. </p>
  <h3>User test</h3>
  <p> Question:<br>
    How do you think the website structure is?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    The structure is very good and it I think it looks proffesional </p>
  <p> Question:<br>
    Do you think the links are easy to navigate?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    I should get used to the bottom in the project pages and I don't like that it opens a new tab everytime I push it. Besides that it is fine. </p>
  <p> Question:<br>
    What do you think about the design?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    It's alright but the frontpage could use a little work and I don't like that dark blue so much. </p>
  <p> Question:<br>
    Do you like the responsive menu and the logos?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    I think that's the best part. That and the photoalbum in the project pages. </p>
